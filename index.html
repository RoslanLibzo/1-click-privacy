  <h1>Privacy Policy for 1‑Click Magic</h1>
  <p>Last updated: June 10, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    1‑Click Magic (“we”, “us”) is a tool for uploading videos to platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.
    Since this app is for personal use by the page admin only, we collect minimal data necessary to run it.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Video files:</strong> Temporary files you upload for posting to social platforms.</li>
    <li><strong>Text fields:</strong> Title and description you provide during upload.</li>
    <li><strong>Access tokens:</strong> Stored securely in your local environment to allow posting on your behalf.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>
    All data (videos, titles, descriptions, and tokens) remain on your server. We do not share it with anyone or use it for secondary purposes.
    Once a video is successfully posted, the local file may be deleted or retained at your discretion.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your data to outside parties.</p>

  <h2>5. Third‑Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The app uses third-party APIs (Facebook, YouTube, Instagram) only at your explicit command during video uploads.
    We recommend reviewing their individual privacy policies for details on how they process content.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Uploaded videos and related fields are stored on your server’s “uploads/” folder.
    You can remove these files at any time to free up disk space.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>This tool is not designed for use by minors and does not knowingly collect data from individuals under the age of 13.</p>

  <h2>8. Privacy Rights</h2>
  <p>
    As long as you control this app, you have full access to view, delete, or modify uploaded videos and their data.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this policy over time. The “Last updated” date at the top will reflect any changes.
